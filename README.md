# Uncertainty Calibration in Bayesian Hierarchical Models: A Simulation Study

> ** WORK IN PROGRESS** – This is an ongoing research project. Current simulation progress: 40% complete. Results are preliminary and subject to change. Expected completion: May 2026.

## Overview

A Monte Carlo simulation study investigating the finite-sample performance of Bayesian hierarchical models, focusing on uncertainty calibration in small-group settings.

## Research Questions

1. How do hierarchical estimators compare to no-pooling and complete-pooling alternatives?
2. Do Bayesian credible intervals achieve nominal coverage in small-group regimes?
3. When do hierarchical models provide advantages over simpler alternatives?

## Current Status

-  Simulation infrastructure: Complete
-  Core simulations: 40% complete
-  Manuscript: In draft
-  Target completion: May 2026

## Methodology

**Simulation Design:**
- Number of groups (J): 5, 10, 30
- Group sample size (n): 3, 5, 10
- Between-group variance (τ²): 0.1, 1, 5
- Within-group variance (σ²): 1, 4
- Total: 54 configurations × 1,000 replications = 54,000 datasets

**Methods Compared:**
1. Bayesian hierarchical model (partial pooling)
2. No pooling (independent groups)
3. Complete pooling (single mean)
4. Bootstrap percentile intervals
5. Bootstrap BCa intervals

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Point estimation: Bias, RMSE
- Interval estimation: Coverage probability, average width

## Preliminary Findings

*Note: Based on incomplete simulations (40%). Subject to revision.*

- Hierarchical models show lower RMSE when heterogeneity is high (τ² ≥ 1) and groups are small (n ≤ 10)
- Observed coverage rates: Hierarchical 94.2%, No pooling 95.1%, Bootstrap 91-94%
- Bootstrap methods show potential undercoverage in small-sample settings
- Complete pooling performs poorly unless heterogeneity is minimal
